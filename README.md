# Meta/Facebook Conversions API

A mostly-generated api client for the [Meta conversions API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api). It is generated from the [swagger definitions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Facebook-Server-Side-API-Swagger). There is only a tiny wrapper added to make the api sane.
